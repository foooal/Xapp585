5. INSTALLATION AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS

Choose whether your design needs SDR or DDR techniques using the application note and
enclosed spreadsheet.

Make sure to have Vivado_2017.4 or later installed.

To incorporate the appropriate module into a Vivado design project:
Read the readme files in teh different directories.

Design guidelines that hav enot been changed.
Verilog flow:

1) For SDR receiver designs, instantiate the receiver module n_x_serdes_1_to_7_mmcm_idelay_sdr.v and set
   the number of channels (N) and number of data-bits per channel (D) appropriately for the application.
   An example top-level design for 2 channels of 5-bits each is provided in the .zip file
2) For SDR transmitter designs, instantiate the receiver module n_x_serdes_7_to_1_diff_sdr.v and the clock
   generator module clock_generator_pll_7_to_1_diff_sdr.v and set the number of channels (N) and number
   of data-bits per channel (D) appropriately for the application.
   An example top-level design for 2 channels of 5-bits each is provided in the .zip file
3) For DDR receiver designs, instantiate the receiver module n_x_serdes_1_to_7_mmcm_idelay_ddr.v and set
   the number of channels (N) and number of data-bits per channel (D) appropriately for the application.
   An example top-level design for 2 channels of 5-bits each is provided in the .zip file
4) For DDR transmitter designs, instantiate the receiver module n_x_serdes_7_to_1_diff_ddr.v and the clock
   generator module clock_generator_pll_7_to_1_diff_ddr.v and set the number of channels (N) and number
   of data-bits per channel (D) appropriately for the application.
   An example top-level design for 2 channels of 5-bits each is provided in the .zip file
5) For designs containing both a receiver and a transmitter, the clock from the reciver module can be used
   for transmission instead of those from the clock generator module

VHDL flow:

1) For SDR receiver designs, instantiate the receiver module n_x_serdes_1_to_7_mmcm_idelay_sdr.vhd and
   set the number of channels (N) and number of data-bits per channel (D) appropriately for the application.
   An example top-level design for 2 channels of 5-bits each is provided in the .zip file
2) For SDR transmitter designs, instantiate the receiver module n_x_serdes_7_to_1_diff_sdr.vhd and the
   clock generator module clock_generator_pll_7_to_1_diff_sdr.vhd and set the number of channels (N) and
   number of data-bits per channel (D) appropriately for the application.
   An example top-level design for 2 channels of 5-bits each is provided in the .zip file
3) For DDR receiver designs, instantiate the receiver module n_x_serdes_1_to_7_mmcm_idelay_ddr.vhd and
   set the number of channels (N) and number of data-bits per channel (D) appropriately for the application.
   An example top-level design for 2 channels of 5-bits each is provided in the .zip file
4) For DDR transmitter designs, instantiate the receiver module n_x_serdes_7_to_1_diff_ddr.vhd and the
   clock generator module clock_generator_pll_7_to_1_diff_ddr.vhd and set the number of channels (N) and
   number of data-bits per channel (D) appropriately for the application.
   An example top-level design for 2 channels of 5-bits each is provided in the .zip file
5) For designs containing both a receiver and a transmitter, the clock from the reciver module can be used
   for transmission instead of those from the clock generator module


6. OTHER INFORMATION (OPTIONAL)

1) Warnings


2) Design Notes


3) Fixes


4) Known Issues

When processing these designs with ISE version 14.1, map will possibly give an error. The fix for this
condition is to set the  "-ignore_keep_hierarchy" option in map, either via the graphical user interface,
or as a command line option.
